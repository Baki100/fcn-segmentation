# 🖼️ Fully Convolutional Neural Networks for Image Segmentation
This notebook illustrates how to build a Fully Convolutional Neural Network for semantic image segmentation. 🌐

## 📖 Introduction
In this project, we demonstrate the process of building and training a Fully Convolutional Neural Network (FCN) for semantic image segmentation. The FCN architecture enables end-to-end dense predictions, essential for tasks like image segmentation. 🖼️

## 📂 Dataset
You will train the model on a custom dataset prepared by divamgupta. This dataset contains video frames from a moving vehicle and is a subsample of the CamVid dataset. 🗂️

## 🏗️ Model Architecture
The model uses a pretrained VGG-16 network for the feature extraction path. The feature extraction is followed by an FCN-8 network for upsampling and generating predictions. The output is a label map (segmentation mask) with predictions for 12 classes. 🏗️

## 🏋️ Training
The training process involves fine-tuning the pretrained VGG-16 network on the custom dataset and training the FCN-8 network to learn the upsampling for precise segmentation. 🏋️

## 🧪 Evaluation
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as pixel accuracy and mean Intersection over Union (IoU) to ensure high-quality segmentation results. 🧪
